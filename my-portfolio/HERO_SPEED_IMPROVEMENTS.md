## 🎨 Enhanced Animation Curve

Changed easing from:
```tsx
// Before: Smooth but slow
ease: [0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1]

// After: Snappier and energetic
ease: [0.22, 1, 0.36, 1]
```

This is a **"ease-out-expo"** curve that:
- Starts fast
- Decelerates quickly
- Feels more responsive
- Modern and energetic

## 📊 Detailed Changes

### 1. **Background - Instant Visibility**
```tsx
// Added instant fade-in for background
initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
transition={{ duration: 0.3 }}  // Super fast!
```

### 2. **Badge - 50% Faster**
```tsx
// Before: 0.8s
// After: 0.4s
duration: 0.4
```

### 3. **Heading Words - Snappier Entrance**
```tsx
// Reduced movement
y: 50 → 30  // 40% less distance
filter: 'blur(10px)' → 'blur(8px)'  // 20% less blur

// Faster animation
duration: 0.8 → 0.5  // 37% faster
staggerChildren: 0.08 → 0.04  // 50% faster stagger
delayChildren: 0.2 → 0.1  // 50% faster start
```

### 4. **Subtitles - Quicker Appearance**
```tsx
// Less movement
y: 20 → 15

// Faster timing
duration: 0.8 → 0.5
delay: 0.5 → 0.3  (first subtitle)
delay: 0.7 → 0.4  (second subtitle)
```

### 5. **Buttons - Earlier Display**
```tsx
duration: 0.8 → 0.5
delay: 0.9 → 0.5  // Show 0.4s earlier!
```

### 6. **Stats Cards - Much Earlier**
```tsx
duration: 0.8 → 0.5
delay: 1.1 → 0.6  // Show 0.5s earlier!
```

### 7. **Scroll Indicator - Way Earlier**
```tsx
duration: 0.8 → 0.5
delay: 1.8 → 0.8  // Show 1.0s earlier!
```

## 🎬 New Animation Timeline

```
0.0s  ━━━━━━━━━━ Background appears (0.3s fade)
0.0s  ━━━━ Badge fades in (0.4s)
0.1s  ━ "Building" appears (0.5s)
0.14s ━ "Digital" appears (0.5s)
0.18s ━ "Excellence" appears (0.5s)
0.3s  ━━━━ First subtitle (0.5s)
0.4s  ━━━━ Second subtitle (0.5s)

      ↓
1.3s  ✅ Everything loaded and visible!
```

**Previous timeline:** ~2.6s
**New timeline:** ~1.3s

## 🚀 User Experience Improvements

### Before:
- ⏱️ Felt slow to load
- 😴 Users waited ~2.6s to see everything
- 🐌 Animations felt draggy
- 💤 Long delays between elements

### After:
- ⚡ Instant background
- 🎯 All content visible in ~1.3s
- 💨 Snappy, energetic feel
- ⚡ Quick succession of elements
- 🎨 Still smooth, just faster!

## 🎯 Scrolling Behavior

The parallax scrolling remains **smooth and natural**:
- Spring physics still active (stiffness: 60, damping: 25)
- Gentle parallax range (200px / 350px)
- Soft fade and blur on scroll
- No jerkiness

**Best of both worlds:**
✅ Fast initial load
✅ Smooth scrolling transitions

## 💡 Technical Notes

### Easing Curve Comparison:

**Old curve [0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1]:**
- Smooth ease-out
- Slower deceleration
- More "floaty" feel

**New curve [0.22, 1, 0.36, 1]:**
- Fast ease-out
- Quick deceleration
- More "snappy" feel
- Used by modern apps (Linear, Notion)

### Movement Reduction:
- Badge: 20px (unchanged)
- Words: 50px → 30px
- Subtitles: 20px → 15px
- Buttons/Cards: 20px → 15px

**Why?** Less movement = faster perception + smoother feel
